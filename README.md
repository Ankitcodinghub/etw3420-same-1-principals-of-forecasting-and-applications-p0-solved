ASSIGNMENT TASK

Assignment Aim

To quantify the forecasted loss in US revenue passenger miles since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Instructions

Proceed with the prescribed Forecasting Process below. Write a research report based on your analysis. Your report should include tables and graphs and an associated narrative. Keep the report concise and clear. Thoughtfulness, clarity of your discussion and the communication of your results are important.

The Appendix does not constitute part of the 15-page limit.

‚Ä¢ Provide a brief background of revenue passenger miles as an airline traffic statistic in the United States by referring to appropriate academic/news article citations.

‚Ä¢ Subsequently, provide a narration of how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the airline industry in the United States.Add

‚Ä¢ In relation to the Assignment Aim above, define the goal of the forecasting problem that you are going to address in this report.

‚Äì You will gain a better understanding of the purpose of this forecasting exercise after completing this assignment. Hence, it is advised to write this part of the introduction after completing the other assignment tasks below.

‚Ä¢ Students should write no more than 1 page for this Stage.

‚Ä¢ You will obtain data on US revenue passenger miles from the CEIC database.

This database contains numerous datasets on economic and business data of countries around the world.

The Teaching Team will provide your student email to CEIC who will manually register each student. An automated email will then be sent to students respectively to setup your password.

Below are the CEIC details after receiving the automated

Each user has up to 3 browser/device accesses and each new browser access will require a PIN which will be automatically sent to the registered email address.

Any issues or queries can be sent to either Ms. Karen Koo (kkoo@isimarkets.com) or the Helpdesk team : helpdesk@ceicdata.com

‚Ä¢ When you have logged into the CEIC database, search for the monthly Air Carrier Traffic:

Revenue Passenger Miles for United States from the ‚ÄòGlobal Database‚Äô

‚Ä¢ Import the data into RStudio to begin your analysis, doing the needful to convert it into a time-series object.

‚Ä¢ For this Stage in the assignment, no detailed write-up is required. However, for theAdd purpose of completeness of presentation, you can just briefly write a sentence stating where the data was obtained from. This part of the assignment is mainly to give students first-hand experience of searching for and downloading data from a database.

‚Ä¢ Plot suitable time series graphics. Do not plot graphs for the sake of plotting them ‚Äì be selective on the number and type of graphs you want to display.

‚Ä¢ Describe in detail your time series graphics, making sure to identify any patterns or outliers. If applicable, are there any particular explanations as to why your data plots display certain interesting features (e.g. what event happened to explain a sudden jump or drop in data)?

‚Ä¢ Based on your data visualization, determine the choice of your time span. That is, determine how far back into the past you want to consider for this assignment.

‚Ä¢ The resulting data set from this stage will be referred to as the ‚Äúfull dataset‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ First, using your full dataset defined from Stage 4, partition your series into two parts labelled as ‚ÄúPre-Covid‚Äù and ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù.

The ‚ÄúPre-Covid‚Äù part comprises of data prior to the start of the pandemic in the ‚Äì

United States.

‚Äì Ensure that the ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù part comprises of data that coincides with the time frameAdd when the United States was affected by the pandemic.

‚Ä¢ Next, divide the ‚ÄúPre-Covid‚Äù dataset into a training set and test set. Be sure to state the time periods over which your training and test sets span, respectively. Also report the number of observations in each of these sets.

‚Ä¢ Using appropriate tools and methods, identify

(i) ONE of the four simple forecasting methods from Topic 3 and

(ii) TWO ETS exponential smoothing models that you would consider using for forecasting. Justify your answers.

‚Ä¢ Using the training set data, fit your identified forecasting method/models from above, and also use the ets() function in R to automatically select an ETS model. Report the ETS model selected by R.

You should have a total of FOUR forecasting method/models.

Note: In some cases, it is possible that your identified ETS model selected might coincide with the ETS model chosen by the ets() function. In this case, then you will have THREE forecasting method/models.

‚Ä¢ For the exponential smoothing models, report the parameter estimates and initial values, along with some summary measures of the within-sample forecast residuals in a table. What can you infer from the magnitude of some of the estimated smoothing parameters?

‚Ä¢ Produce separate plots of the training set data with the fitted values from each of the method/models. Ensure that your plots are correctly labelled. Comment on the plots.

‚Ä¢ Perform residual diagnostic checks for all the method/models.

‚Ä¢ Which of the above method/models has the best goodness of fit? Explain if this is what you expected.

‚Ä¢ Use each of the above method/models to produce forecasts for the test set period. Subsequently, plot the ‚ÄúPre-Covid‚Äù data set (i.e. both training and test set data), along with the forecasts produced by the 4 forecasting methods/models.Add ‚Äì Do not include prediction intervals in the plot.

‚Äì Make sure that your axes are labeled correctly, along with the chart title.

‚Äì Make sure that you insert a legend in the plot, correctly labeling the various forecasts.

‚Ä¢ Describe the forecast plots in detail, giving explanations as to why the test set forecasts produced by the above methods/models look as such.

‚Ä¢ Evaluate the out-of-sample forecast accuracy of the 4 forecasting method/models by using the traditional approach. Be sure to articulate the process on how you did this evaluation. Which method/models forecasts best?

‚Ä¢ Evaluate the forecasting performance of the 4 method/models using time series crossvalidation with a forecast horizon of h = 12. Do you come to the same conclusion?

‚Ä¢ Which forecasting method/model would you finally select for producing forecasts?

Explain.

‚Ä¢ Using your selected forecasting method/model from Stage 7, re-estimate the parameters using the ‚ÄúPre-Covid‚Äù data set.

‚Ä¢ Report the new estimated parameter values in a table, if applicable.

‚Ä¢ Using the new set of estimated parameters, produce forecasts for the ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù time period.

‚Ä¢ Produce a plot of the full dataset (see Stage 4) with the forecasts. Ensure the plot islabeled correctly.

‚Ä¢ Describe the pattern of the forecasts, including the forecast intervals. Do they look reasonable?

‚Ä¢ Compare the forecasts with the actual revenue passenger miles in the ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù time period. Add

‚Ä¢ Using all the results obtained so far,

‚Äì Calculate the forecasted loss in revenue passenger miles (in billions) sustained by the United States since the start of the pandemic.

‚Äì Calculate a range of forecasted loss in revenue passenger miles.

‚Ä¢ To conclude the report, provide a summary of what has been done and some policy recommendations based on your results.
